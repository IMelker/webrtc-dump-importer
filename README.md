## Import webrtc-internal dumps
Chrome webrtc-internals page is tremendously useful but lacks the ability to reimport the exported dumps.
My efforts to fix this in chrome were are bitrotting in the chromium tracker for two years now.

But heck, I can just make a web page to do it. And use a [better library for graphs](http://www.highcharts.com/) (note that commercial usage requires a license) which adds the ability to zoom into regions of interest.
